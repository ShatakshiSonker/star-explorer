<div class="quotefacts">“<em>The sun, the moon and the stars would have disappeared long ago . . . had they happened to be within the reach of predatory human hands.</em>”<br>
— Havelock Ellis, The Dance of Life, 1923</div>
<p>Less than 100 years ago, everyone could look up and see a spectacular starry night sky. Now, millions of children across the globe will never experience the Milky Way where they live. The increased and widespread use of artificial light at night is not only impairing our view of the universe, it is adversely affecting our <a title="Light Pollution Effects on Wildlife and Ecosystems" href="https://www.darksky.org/light-pollution/wildlife/">environment</a>, our <a title="Lighting, Crime and Safety" href="https://www.darksky.org/light-pollution/lighting-crime-and-safety/">safety</a>, our <a title="Light Pollution Wastes Energy and Money" href="https://www.darksky.org/light-pollution/energy-waste/">energy consumption</a> and our <a title="Human Health" href="https://www.darksky.org/light-pollution/human-health/">health</a>.</p>
<h3>What is Light Pollution?</h3>
<p>Most of us are familiar with air, water, and land pollution, but did you know that light can also be a pollutant?</p>
<p>The inappropriate or excessive use of artificial light – known as light pollution – can have serious environmental consequences for humans, wildlife, and our climate. Components of light pollution include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glare</strong> – excessive brightness that causes visual discomfort</li>
<li><strong>Skyglow</strong> – brightening of the night sky over inhabited areas</li>
<li><strong>Light trespass</strong> – light falling where it is not intended or needed</li>
<li><strong>Clutter</strong> – bright, confusing and excessive groupings of light sources</li>
</ul>

<p>Light pollution is a side effect of industrial civilization. Its sources include building exterior and interior lighting, advertising, commercial properties, offices, factories, streetlights, and illuminated sporting venues.</p>
<p>The fact is that much outdoor lighting used at night is inefficient, overly bright, poorly targeted, improperly shielded, and, in many cases, completely unnecessary. This light, and the electricity used to create it, is being wasted by spilling it into the sky, rather than focusing it on to the actual objects and areas that&nbsp;people want illuminated.</p>

<h3>How Bad is Light Pollution?</h3>
<p>With much of the Earth’s population living under light-polluted skies, over lighting&nbsp;is an international concern. If you live in an urban or suburban area all you have to do to see this type of pollution is go outside at night and look up at the sky.</p>
<p>According to the 2016 groundbreaking “<a href="https://www.darksky.org/80-of-world-population-lives-under-skyglow-new-study-finds/">World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness</a>,” 80 percent of the world’s population lives under skyglow. In the United States and Europe 99 percent of the public can’t experience a natural night!</p>

<h3>Effects of Light Pollution</h3>
<p>For three billion years, life on Earth existed in a rhythm of light and dark that was created solely by the illumination of the Sun, Moon and stars. Now, artificial lights overpower the darkness and our cities glow at night, disrupting the natural day-night pattern and shifting the delicate balance of our environment. The negative effects of the loss of this inspirational natural resource might seem intangible. But a growing body of evidence links the brightening night sky directly to measurable negative impacts including</p>
